# social_blog_with_postgres
Created a system to share my site's content by email and created a comment
system for blog. Added tagging to blog posts, integrating a reusable
application, and built complex QuerySets to retrieve objects by similarity.
Created custom Django template tags and filters
to provide templates with a custom functionality. Also created a sitemap for
search engines to crawl my site and an RSS feed for users to subscribe to my
blog.Built a search engine for my blog using the full-text search engine
of PostgreSQL.
